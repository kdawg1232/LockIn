LLM should place green checkmark when the task in the sprint is finished:


Sprint 1 – Auth & First-Screen Skeleton
Goal: Users can sign up / sign in with Supabase auth and land on the bare-bones "Opponent of the Day" home screen.


✅ 1.1 Create Expo project & workspace setup


✅ 1.2 Install core deps (react-native-supabase, react-navigation, tailwind-react-native-classnames, dotenv)


✅ 1.3 Configure .env with Supabase URL & anon key


✅ 1.4 Implement email-password Sign Up form


✅ 1.5 Implement email-password Sign In form


✅ 1.6 Create users table (id, email, created_at, display_name, avatar_url, school, major)


1.7 On first login, write user profile row


1.8 Set up global tailwind styling baseline


1.9 Placehold "Opponent of the Day" card component (static data for now)


1.10 Link a basic Profile screen via header avatar tap


1.11 Test on Android & iOS simulators


1.12 Write unit tests for both frontend and backend in their respective folders.


Definition of Done: A new user can register, log in, and see the scaffolding of the main screen; navigation works, no runtime errors.
